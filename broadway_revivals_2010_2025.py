# Additional notes:
# - CHICAGO is a special case: the 1996 revival has been running continuously through 2010-2025
# - Some shows had multiple revivals in this period (e.g., A VIEW FROM THE BRIDGE in 2010 and 2016)
# - The year shown is the opening year of the revival, not necessarily when it closed
# - Shows like THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA and THE LION KING are original long-running productions, not revivals
# - THE LION KING (1997) and THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA (1988) are NOT revivals
# - WICKED (2003) is NOT a revival - it's an original production
