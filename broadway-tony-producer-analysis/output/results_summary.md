## 2. Main Findings

### Tony Awards and Producer Count

#### 2.1 Tony Wins (Logistic Regression)
**Model:** Logit(P(Tony Win)) ~ producer_count_total

**Key Result:**
- **Odds Ratio:** [X.XX] (95% CI: [X.XX, X.XX])
- **Interpretation:** Each additional producer is associated with a [X]% [increase/decrease] in the odds of winning at least one Tony Award.
- **Statistical Significance:** [p = X.XXX; Significant/Not significant at α=0.05]

**Robustness:**
- Separate analysis for lead vs co-producers: [findings]
- Quartile analysis: [findings]
- Subsample analysis (musicals vs plays): [findings if available]

#### 2.2 Tony Nominations (Count Model)
**Model:** [Poisson/Negative Binomial] regression of Tony nominations on producer count

**Key Result:**
- **Incidence Rate Ratio:** [X.XX] (95% CI: [X.XX, X.XX])
- **Interpretation:** Each additional producer is associated with a [X]% [increase/decrease] in expected Tony nominations.
- **Statistical Significance:** [p = X.XXX; Significant/Not significant]

**Model Selection:**
- Dispersion test: [Result - Poisson appropriate / Over-dispersed, used NB]

---

### Weekly Grosses and Producer Count

#### 3.1 Panel Regression
**Model:** log(Weekly Gross) ~ producer_count + week_number + post_tony + [controls]

**Key Result:**
- **Coefficient on producer_count:** [X.XXX] (SE: [X.XXX])
- **Interpretation:** Each additional producer is associated with a [X.X]% change in weekly gross revenue.
- **Statistical Significance:** [p = X.XXX; Significant/Not significant]

**Controls included:** [List controls if any]

**Sample:**
- [N] show-week observations
- [N] unique shows
- [If data not available: Analysis not performed due to missing grosses data]

---

### Show Run Length and Producer Count

#### 4.1 Kaplan-Meier Survival Analysis
- Shows with high producer count (top quartile) vs low producer count (bottom quartile)
- [Median survival time comparison]
- Log-rank test: [p = X.XXX]

#### 4.2 Cox Proportional Hazards Model
**Model:** Hazard of closing ~ producer_count + [controls]

**Key Result:**
- **Hazard Ratio:** [X.XX] (95% CI: [X.XX, X.XX])
- **Interpretation:**
  - If HR < 1: Each additional producer is associated with a [X]% decrease in the hazard of closing (longer run).
  - If HR > 1: Each additional producer is associated with a [X]% increase in the hazard of closing (shorter run).
- **Statistical Significance:** [p = X.XXX; Significant/Not significant]

**Sample:**
- [N] shows
- [N] events (closures)
- [N] censored (still running)
- [If data not available: Analysis not performed due to missing run length data]

## 4. Data Limitations

### Missing Data
1. **Opening/Closing Dates:** [X]% of shows missing → limits survival analysis
2. **Review Scores:** Not available → cannot control for critical reception
3. **Weekly Grosses:** [Coverage summary] → limits panel analysis
4. **Theatre Metadata:** Not available → cannot control for venue size/location
5. **Producer Counts:** [X]% of shows missing → reduced sample size

### Data Quality Issues
1. **Title Matching:** [X] shows required fuzzy matching (potential errors)
2. **Producer Parsing:** [Issues with distinguishing lead vs co-producers]
3. **[Other issues identified]**

### Methodological Limitations
1. **Causality:** All analyses are correlational; cannot infer causation
2. **Selection Bias:** Only Tony-eligible shows included
3. **Omitted Variables:** Cannot control for budget, star power, IP familiarity
4. **Time-varying effects:** Producer count measured at opening (may change)

## 5. Interpretation and Discussion

### What We Found
[Narrative summary of key findings in plain language]

### Possible Explanations
[Theoretical interpretations of observed relationships]

Examples:
- **If positive association:** More producers → more resources/networks → better outcomes
- **If negative/null association:** Producer proliferation may be strategic (not causal)
- **Alternative explanations:** [Confounding factors, selection effects, etc.]

### Comparison to Prior Work
[If any academic or industry reports exist on this topic]

## 6. Implications

### For Producers
[What do these findings suggest for Broadway producers?]

### For Industry
[What do these findings suggest about Broadway production structure?]

### For Research
[What further research is needed?]

## 7. Future Work

### Data Enhancements Needed
1. Complete opening/closing date data → enables proper survival analysis
2. NYT review scores → improves control for show quality
3. Capitalization data → controls for production budget
4. Star power indicators → controls for celebrity casting
5. Complete weekly grosses → improves panel analysis

### Methodological Extensions
1. Instrumental variables (if credible instruments exist)
2. Difference-in-differences (if natural experiment)
3. Network analysis (producer collaboration networks)
4. Temporal trends (has producer count changed over time?)
5. Interaction effects (producer count × musical/play, × season, etc.)
