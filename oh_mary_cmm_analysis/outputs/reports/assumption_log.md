## Methodological Decisions and Limitations

1. Reddit data: No API access. Template created for manual entry. Analysis will proceed with available data from other platforms.

2. TikTok data: Automated scraping blocked. Template created for manual entry. Consider using third-party APIs (Apify, RapidAPI) for comprehensive TikTok data.

3. Instagram data: Requires authentication. Template created for manual entry. Consider using Instagram Basic Display API or third-party scrapers.

4. DEMO MODE: No real data collected. Using synthetic examples to demonstrate analysis pipeline. Results are for illustration only.
