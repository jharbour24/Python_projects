## What This Analysis Does

### 1. Reddit Data Collection
- Scrapes Reddit posts and comments for all shows
- Searches 11 curated subreddits (Broadway, musicals, theatre, NYC, LGBTQ+, entertainment)
- Collects: upvotes, comments, sentiment, engagement metrics
- Time period: Last 12 months

### 2. Broadway Box Office Data Collection
- Scrapes weekly grosses from BroadwayWorld.com JSON API
- Uses `json_grosses.cfm` endpoint (more reliable than HTML scraping)
- Covers full 2024-2025 Tony season (April 2024 - present)
- Collects: weekly gross revenue, capacity %, average ticket price, attendance, performances

### 3. Statistical Analysis (WHAT)
- Extracts 30+ metrics per show from Reddit data
- Performs t-tests comparing successful vs unsuccessful campaigns
- Calculates effect sizes (Cohen's d) and confidence intervals
- Identifies which metrics significantly differentiate success/failure

### 4. Qualitative Analysis (WHY)
- Analyzes conversation themes (performance, creative, emotional, identity, etc.)
- Identifies viral content characteristics
- Examines audience language patterns and tone
- Discovers what messaging resonates with communities

### 5. Correlation Analysis (Reddit vs Grosses)
- Merges Reddit engagement data with box office performance
- Calculates correlations between social metrics and financial success
- Identifies over/underperformers (shows that defy the buzz-to-revenue pattern)
- Analyzes patterns by show type (original vs revival, play vs musical)

### 6. Lagged Causality Analysis (PUBLICATION-READY) 🆕
**Advanced econometric analysis testing whether social media buzz predicts future box office grosses.**

**Research Question**: Does Reddit engagement at time t-k predict Broadway grosses at time t?

**Key Features**:
- **Panel regression** with show and time fixed effects
- **Cluster-robust standard errors** (accounts for correlation within shows)
- **Advance purchase hypothesis testing**: Default lag = 4 weeks (≈31 days typical ticket purchase)
- **Granger causality tests**: Does engagement temporally precede grosses?
- **Sensitivity analysis**: Robust to lag specification (tests 1, 2, 4, 6 weeks)

**Statistical Models**:
1. **OLS with Fixed Effects** (statsmodels)
   - Controls for show-specific factors (quality, stars, genre)
   - Controls for time trends (seasonality, market conditions)
   - Cluster-robust SEs by show

2. **Panel Within Estimator** (linearmodels.PanelOLS)
   - Entity (show) and time (week) fixed effects
   - More efficient for balanced panels
   - Industry-standard panel data method

3. **Granger Causality Tests**
   - Tests temporal precedence: does X at t-k predict Y at t?
   - Aggregates evidence across shows using Fisher's method
   - Reports % of shows with significant predictive power

**Outputs**:
- Publication-ready coefficient tables with 95% CIs
- Model diagnostics (R², F-tests, within/between variance)
- Sensitivity analyses showing robustness
- JSON/TXT/CSV formats for further analysis

**Usage**:
```bash
# 1. Build the merged panel dataset
python3 build_panel_dataset.py

# 2. Run main causal analysis (4-week lag)
python3 run_lagged_causality_analysis.py

# 3. Test sensitivity to lag choice
python3 run_lagged_causality_analysis.py --sensitivity

# 4. Run Granger causality tests
python3 run_lagged_causality_analysis.py --granger

# 5. Full analysis suite
python3 run_lagged_causality_analysis.py --full
```

**Interpretation**:
- Positive coefficient on lagged engagement → Social buzz predicts future grosses
- Significant p-value (p < 0.05) → Effect is statistically distinguishable from zero
- Granger test significance → Temporal precedence established (not just correlation)

**Academic Rigor**:
- Addresses endogeneity through lagged predictors and fixed effects
- Controls for supply constraints (capacity flags)
- Accounts for show lifecycle (preview vs post-opening)
- Cluster-robust inference prevents overconfident conclusions

## Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Mac or Linux (Windows with WSL)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
cd /path/to/oh_mary_cmm_analysis
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Verify configuration:
```bash
cat config/config.yaml
```

## Running the Complete Analysis

### Option 1: Run Everything (Recommended)

```bash
python3 run_success_failure_analysis.py
```

This runs all 5 steps sequentially:
1. Reddit data collection (2-3 hours)
2. Broadway grosses scraping (10-15 minutes)
3. Statistical analysis (5-10 minutes)
4. Qualitative analysis (5-10 minutes)
5. Correlation analysis (2-3 minutes)

**Total time: ~2.5-3.5 hours**

### Option 2: Run Individual Scripts

If you want to run steps separately:

```bash
# Step 1: Collect Reddit data
python3 multi_show_reddit_scraper.py

# Step 2: Scrape Broadway grosses
python3 broadway_grosses_scraper.py

# Step 3: Statistical analysis
python3 marketing_science_analysis.py

# Step 4: Qualitative analysis
python3 why_campaigns_succeed_analysis.py

# Step 5: Correlation analysis
python3 reddit_grosses_correlation_analysis.py
```

### Option 3: Simple Marketing Effectiveness (Alternative)

For a simpler analysis without complex statistics:

```bash
python3 marketing_effectiveness_analysis.py
```

This provides straightforward engagement, reach, sentiment, and word-of-mouth scores.

## Configuration

### Adding/Removing Shows

Edit `config/config.yaml`:

```yaml
shows:
  show_id:
    name: "Show Name"
    show_type: "original_play|original_musical|play_revival|musical_revival"
    category: "successful|unsuccessful|unknown"
    keywords:
      - "Keyword 1"
      - "Keyword 2"
```

### Adjusting Search Parameters

```yaml
reddit:
  subreddits:
    - broadway
    - musicals
    # Add more subreddits

limits:
  reddit_posts_per_subreddit: 100  # Adjust for faster/slower scraping
```

## Technical Details

### Reddit API
- Uses PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper)
- Credentials hardcoded in `multi_show_reddit_scraper.py`
- Rate limited to avoid API restrictions
- Searches 11 verified subreddits
- Only uses first keyword per show to reduce API calls

### BroadwayWorld Scraping
- Uses JSON API endpoint (`json_grosses.cfm`) instead of HTML page scraping
- BeautifulSoup parses HTML fragments from API responses
- Respectful rate limiting (0.5 second delays between weeks)
- Fetches both musicals and plays for each week
- Matches show names to config via exact and keyword matching

### Statistical Methods
- T-tests for comparing group means
- Cohen's d for effect size
- 95% confidence intervals
- Pearson and Spearman correlations

### Qualitative Methods
- Theme extraction via keyword matching
- Sentiment analysis using word lists
- Viral content pattern identification
- Language tone analysis (personal vs collective voice)

## Troubleshooting

### Reddit Scraper Hangs
- Reduced to 25 posts per subreddit to prevent hanging
- If still hanging, reduce `reddit_posts_per_subreddit` in config.yaml

### No Grosses Data / Missing Shows
- **Script now uses BroadwayWorld JSON API** (much more reliable than HTML scraping)
- If no data is found:
  1. Check network connectivity
  2. Verify the API endpoint is still available: https://www.broadwayworld.com/json_grosses.cfm
  3. Try running `broadway_grosses_scraper.py` directly to see detailed error messages
- If some shows are missing:
  - Show names in config.yaml may not match BroadwayWorld's naming
  - Check `match_show_to_config()` function in `broadway_grosses_scraper.py`
  - Add alternative keywords to config.yaml for better matching
  - Check BroadwayWorld website to see exact show names used

### Correlation Analysis Shows "No Data"
- Ensure both Reddit and grosses data exist
- Run `multi_show_reddit_scraper.py` first
- Then run `broadway_grosses_scraper.py`
- Then run correlation analysis

### Import Errors (scipy, etc.)
- scipy is optional - code will work without it
- If issues persist, check `requirements.txt` compatibility
- Mac M1/M2: Use simplified requirements (no Fortran dependencies)
